My name is Philip Trettner and I'm co-founder of [Shaped Code](https://shapedcode.com/) where I'm available as freelancer and contractor.

Recently, I finished my time as a PhD student in computer graphics at the [Visual Computing Institute](https://graphics.rwth-aachen.de/) of the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), Germany.

This is my personal blog where I write about programming, C++, computer science, optimization, technology, and more.
I'm mainly interested in:

* Computer Graphics
* C++ and OpenGL
* Optimization and Efficiency
* Game Development
* Library Development and API Design
* Programming Language Design
* Procedural Generation
* Geometry Processing

I hope to one day write about the programming language I'm designing.

It seems nowadays necessary to point out that all expressed opinions are my own.
